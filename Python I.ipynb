    "Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer. He created Python in the late 1980s while working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) in the Netherlands. The first version of Python, version 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. Since then, Python has undergone numerous updates and revisions, with the latest stable version being Python 3.10, released in October 2021."

    "Memory management is handled automatically by the Python interpreter. Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of objects in memory.\n",

This can help to reduce the amount of memory that is used by a Python program.\n",
