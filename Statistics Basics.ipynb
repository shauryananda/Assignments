    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics deals with the collection and presentation of data in a summarized and understandable format. It summarizes and describes the main features of a data set, such as its center, variability, shape, and spread. Descriptive statistics can be useful in a wide range of applications, such as market research, opinion polls, and public health studies. For example, a marketing research firm may use descriptive statistics to summarize data on consumer preferences, such as the most popular brand of soft drink or the average age of their target audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics involves making inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It uses statistical models and probability theory to test hypotheses and draw conclusions about the population from which the sample was drawn. Inferential statistics can be used in fields such as epidemiology, social sciences, and quality control. For example, a pharmaceutical company may use inferential statistics to determine whether a new drug is effective by testing it on a sample of patients and then drawing conclusions about the larger population of patients with a similar condition.\n",

    "Nominal Data: Nominal data refers to data that is categorical in nature and can be put into categories, but the categories do not have any inherent order or ranking. For example, the types of fruits in a grocery store can be nominal data since there is no inherent ranking between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Data: Ordinal data refers to data that has a natural order or ranking to it, but the differences between the values are not consistent or well-defined. For example, a rating system for customer satisfaction ranging from \"very unsatisfied\" to \"very satisfied\" is ordinal data because it has a natural order but the difference between the values is not necessarily equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Data: Interval data refers to data that has a natural order and the differences between values are well-defined and equal, but there is no true zero point. For example, temperature measurements in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit are interval data because they have a natural order, and the difference between values is well-defined, but there is no true zero point in the temperature scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio Data: Ratio data refers to data that has a natural order, the differences between values are well-defined and equal, and there is a true zero point. For example, weight, height, and time are examples of ratio data because they have a natural order, the difference between values is well-defined and equal, and there is a true zero point (e.g., zero kilograms or zero seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the types of data is the level of measurement and the information conveyed by the data. Nominal data only conveys information about categories, ordinal data provides information about ranking, interval data provides information about magnitude and the difference between values, and ratio data provides information about magnitude, difference, and true zero point."

Values beyond this range are shown as individual points or dots, which represent outliers.\n",
