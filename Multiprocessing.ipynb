    "Multiprocessing in Python is a technique of utilizing multiple CPUs or cores of a computer to perform multiple tasks in parallel. It allows multiple processes to run concurrently, each with its own memory space, and each executing on its own processor. Multiprocessing can significantly improve the performance of CPU-bound tasks in Python, such as intensive calculations, data processing, or scientific simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is useful because it enables parallelism, which can lead to significant speedup in CPU-bound tasks. With multiprocessing, a program can divide a large task into multiple smaller sub-tasks, each running in its own process on a separate CPU or core. This can lead to faster execution times and better overall system utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing can also improve the responsiveness of a program, as it allows multiple processes to run simultaneously, each with its own priority and scheduling. This can be particularly useful for programs that interact with user interfaces or need to respond to external events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a built-in multiprocessing module that makes it easy to write parallel programs. The multiprocessing module provides a Process class that can be used to spawn new processes, and a variety of synchronization primitives such as Locks, Semaphores, and Queues that can be used to coordinate communication and resource sharing between processes.\n",

    "Execution model: In multiprocessing, each process runs in its own memory space and has its own instance of Python interpreter, while in multithreading, all threads share the same memory space and the same instance of Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency: Multiprocessing provides true concurrency as multiple processes can run in parallel on multiple CPUs or cores, while multithreading provides only pseudo-concurrency as only one thread can execute at a time on a single CPU or core, and the operating system switches between threads rapidly to give the appearance of concurrent execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead: Multiprocessing has higher overhead than multithreading due to the need to create new processes and copy memory between them, while multithreading has lower overhead as threads share the same memory space and can communicate more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation: Multiprocessing provides better isolation between processes as each process has its own memory space, while multithreading has less isolation as threads share the same memory space and can access the same variables and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multiprocessing is more complex to program than multithreading due to the need to manage multiple processes and communicate between them, while multithreading is simpler to program as all threads share the same memory space and can communicate using synchronization primitives."
