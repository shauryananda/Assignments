    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is disrupted and the program terminates abnormally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for a variety of reasons, such as trying to perform an invalid operation, accessing a resource that is not available, or encountering an unexpected condition. Python provides a built-in mechanism to handle exceptions using try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when there is a problem with the syntax of the program. Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the compilation of the program, and prevent the program from executing at all. Examples of syntax errors include forgetting to close a parentheses, misspelling a keyword, or forgetting a colon at the end of a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the compilation of the program, while exceptions are detected during the execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Occurrence: Syntax errors occur when there is a problem with the syntax of the program, while exceptions occur when there is an error during the execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling: Syntax errors must be fixed by editing the program and correcting the syntax, while exceptions can be handled by using try-except blocks to gracefully recover from the error and continue executing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Syntax errors prevent the program from executing at all, while exceptions can be handled and the program can continue executing despite the error."
